# qPCRCalc — qPCR Delta-Delta-Ct Analysis

## Domain
- Livak ΔΔCt method for relative gene expression quantification
- Reference gene normalization
- Fold change calculation with error propagation
- Replicate QC (CV% flagging)

## Key Equations
- ΔCt: `Ct_target - Ct_reference`
- ΔΔCt: `ΔCt_sample - mean(ΔCt_control)`
- Fold change: `2^(-ΔΔCt)`
- Error bars: `SEM = SD/√n`, bounds = `2^(-(ΔΔCt ± SEM))`

## Quality Control
- Flag CV% > 2% (suspicious), > 5% (unreliable)
- Flag Ct > 35 (low expression / noise threshold)

## Validation Sources
- Livak & Schmittgen (2001) method paper worked examples
- Bio-Rad CFX Manager output comparison
- Published qPCR datasets from GEO/ArrayExpress



# Code Implementation Flow

<important>Mandatory Development Loop (non-negotiable)</important>

## Git Workflow
- **Work directly on master** — solo developer, no branch overhead
- **Commit after every completed unit of work** — never leave working code uncommitted
- **Push after each work session** — remote backup is non-negotiable
- **Tag milestones**: `git tag v0.1.0-mvp` when deploying or reaching a checkpoint
- **Branch only for risky experiments** you might discard — delete after merge or abandon

## Preparation & Definitions
- Use Typescript as default language, unless told otherwise
- Work using TDD with red/green flow ALWAYS
- If its a webapp: Add always Playwright E2E tests
- Separate domain logic from CLI/UI/WebAPI, unless told otherwise
- Every UI/WebAPI feature should have parity with a CLI way of testing that feature

## Validation
After completing any feature:
- Run all new unit tests, validate coverage is over 90%
- Use cli to test new feature
- If its a UI impacting feature: run all e2e tests
- If its a UI impacting feature: do a visual validation using Playwright MCP, take screenshots as you tests and review the screenshots to verify visually all e2e flows and the new feature. <important>If Playwright MCP is not available stop and let the user know</important>

If any of the validations step fail, fix the underlying issue.

## Finishing
- Update documentation for the project based on changes
- <important>Always commit after you finish your work with a message that explain both what is done, the context and a trail of the though process you made </important>


# Deployment

- git push master branch will trigger CI/CD in Github
- CI/CD in Github will run tests, if they pass it will be deployed to Vercel https://qpcrcalc.vercel.app/
- Umami analytics and Feedback form with Supabase database
